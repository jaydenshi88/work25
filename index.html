    <p>Winter in Cairo ushers in a pleasant shift from the intense summer heat, spanning from December to February. Daytime temperatures range from 10 to 20 degrees Celsius, providing a comfortable backdrop for outdoor exploration. While snowfall is exceedingly rare, occasional rainfall freshens the city, offering a break from the prevailing dryness. The iconic landmarks, such as the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx, take on a different charm in the softer winter light. Cairo's lively street life persists with bustling outdoor cafes and markets, where locals and tourists enjoy the milder weather. The season fosters a cultural vibrancy, marked by events and festivals, making winter an ideal time to appreciate the rich history and energetic spirit of this historic city.</p>
